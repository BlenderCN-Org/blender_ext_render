# blender_ext_render
A small blender addon for external rendering support through OBJ files and UDP notifications

It became useful to play around and learn blender plugins for building even greater stuff later.
The original idea was to create support for rendering over Hololens from the blender system.

Only this part is the one which is open sourced as this is just the thing made while learning
and the repository is not getting backports from the real use cases and more sophisticated
solutions for larger integration efforts.
